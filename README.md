# inversewin32
Finished and uploaded January 4th, 2023.
Used C++ and Win32 API (Visual Studio).
This is a simple Windows program that allows the user to input the dimensions of matrix (1~9) and the matrix itself. Then it displays the inverse of the matrix and
the time it took to calculate the inverse. It also returns an error message if the matrix is singular. The program works on Windows 10.
To run: build the solution and run on Visual Studio.
